This is my current digital portfolio site. It's created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

This site is mainly going to be a sandbox to contain small interactive web-based projects used for personal learning and development.

You can find the hosted site [here](https://www.ymumberson.com/).
